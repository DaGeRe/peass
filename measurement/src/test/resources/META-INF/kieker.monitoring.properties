## In order to use a custom Kieker.Monitoring configuration, create a copy of 
## this file and modify it according to your needs. 
##
## The location of the file is passed to Kieker.Monitoring via the JVM parameter
## kieker.monitoring.configuration. For example, with a configuration file named 
## my.kieker.monitoring.properties in the folder META-INF you would pass this location 
## to the JVM when starting your application:
##
##  java -Dkieker.monitoring.configuration=META-INF/my.kieker.monitoring.properties [...]
##
## If no configuration file is passed, Kieker tries to use a configuration file in
## META-INF/kieker.monitoring.properties
## If this also fails, a default configuration is being used according to the values in 
## this default file.

## The name of the Kieker instance.
kieker.monitoring.name=peran-test

## Selection of monitoring data writer (classname)
## The value must be a fully-qualified classname of a class implementing 
## kieker.monitoring.writer.IMonitoringWriter and providing a constructor that 
## accepts a single Configuration.

## Asynchronous writers need to store monitoring records in an internal buffer.
## This parameter defines its capacity in terms of the number of records. 
kieker.monitoring.writer.AsyncDummyWriter.QueueSize=10000
#
## Asynchronous writers need to store specific monitoring records in a prioritized internal buffer.
## This parameter defines its capacity in terms of the number of records. 
kieker.monitoring.writer.AsyncDummyWriter.PrioritizedQueueSize=100
#
## Behavior of the asynchronous writer when the internal queue is full:
## 0: terminate Monitoring with an error (default)
## 1: writer blocks until queue capacity is available
## 2: writer discards new records until space is available
##  Be careful when using the value '1' since then, the asynchronous writer
##  is no longer decoupled from the monitored application.
kieker.monitoring.writer.AsyncDummyWriter.QueueFullBehavior=0
#
## Maximum time to wait for the writer threads to finish (in milliseconds).
## A MaxShutdownDelay of -1 means infinite waiting.
